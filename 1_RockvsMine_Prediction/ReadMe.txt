- 🌊 The project focuses on predicting if an underwater object is a rock or a mine using sonar data collected in a lab setting.(data set used Kaggle Dataset)
- 📝 The use of Google Collaboratory, a cloud-based system, allowed the author to write and execute the Python script without the need for local Python software installation. This made it easier for viewers to follow along with the tutorial.
- 🛠️ The scikit-learn library was used for various tasks, such as data splitting, logistic regression model training, and accuracy score calculation. This library provides efficient tools for machine learning tasks and simplifies the implementation of complex algorithms.
- ⚙️ Google Collaboratory is used for coding, and libraries like NumPy and pandas are imported for data manipulation and analysis.
- 📊 The data is preprocessed, split into training and test sets, and fed into a logistic regression model for binary classification. The data was preprocessed by removing the last column, which represented the labels (rock or mine), and splitting it into features (X) and labels (y). This allowed the model to learn from the features and make predictions based on them.

- 📚 The sonar data is loaded into a pandas data frame, analyzed for statistical measures, and visualized.
- ➡️ The data is split into features and labels, and the training and test sets are created using the train_test_split function.
- 🧠 A logistic regression model is trained with the training data and evaluated for accuracy on both training and test data.
- ✔️ The accuracy scores demonstrate how well the model can predict if an object is a rock or a mine.
- 📈 The accuracy score of the trained model was around 83% for the training data and 76% for the test data. This indicates that the model performed well in predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine based on the given sonar data.
- 📉 The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and quantity of the data used for training. Having a balanced number of examples for both rocks and mines can lead to better predictions. However, with a small dataset of around 200 examples, the accuracy may be limited.
